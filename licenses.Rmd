# License your GitBook

In the spirit of Open Science, it is good to think about making your course materials Open Source. That means that other people can use them. In principle, if you publish materials online without license information, you hold the copyright to those materials. If you want them to be Open Source, you must include a license.

The Creative Commons licenses are typically suitable for course materials. This GitBook, for example, is licensed under CC-BY 4.0. That means you can use and remix it as you like, but you must credit the original source.
